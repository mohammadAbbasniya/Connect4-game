# Connect4 Game Full Option (AI + GUI)
This is a python package including an implementation of Connect 4 game with a medium level artificial intelligence player developed using minimax algorithm. Iâ€™ve tried to separate different parts of whole project into several classes in order to demonstrate the single responsibility principle.


## About Connect4
Connect Four (also known as Connect 4, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection rack game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves [[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)].
